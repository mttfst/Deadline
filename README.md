# Obsidian Deadline Plugin

## Overview
**Deadline** is an Obsidian plugin designed to help organize and visualize projects and their deadlines in the context of actual available working hours. It balances priorities and deadlines to provide a clear overview of what requires immediate attention.

---

## Settings (Defaults):
- **`project_path`**: `./Projects`  
  *Path to the directory where projects are stored.*

- **`working_hours_per_week`**: `40`  
  *Total available working hours per week.*

- **`working_days_per_week`**: `5`  
  *Number of working days per week.*

- **`priority_levels`**: `3`  
  *Number of priority levels for projects.*

- **`priority_split`**: `[50, 35, 15]`  
  *Percentage of available time allocated to each priority level.*

---

## Commands:

1. **`new_project`**  
   - Creates a new project with a unique `project_id`.  
   - A new directory named after the `project_id` is created in `project_path`.  
   - A `New_Project.md` file is generated in the project directory using the **`project_template`**.

2. **`new_subproject`**  
   - Creates a new subproject within an existing project directory.  
   - A new Markdown file `<Subproject_Name>.md` is created.  
   - The subproject template includes a link to the main project (`main_project`).

3. **`log_time`**  
   - Allows users to select a project or subproject and log time spent in hours (`h`) or minutes (`min`).  
   - Time is logged in a **`time_log.md`** file within the respective project/subproject directory.  
   - The **Progress** section in the main project/subproject file is automatically updated:
     - **Time Spent:** Sum of entries from `time_log.md`.
     - **Time Remaining:** Difference between estimated and logged work time.

---

## Core Logic (Workload Distribution):

1. **Weekly Work Time Distribution by Priority:**  
   - Weekly working hours are distributed based on `priority_split`.

2. **Equal Time Distribution Among Projects of the Same Priority:**  
   - Projects on the same priority level share the allocated time equally.

3. **Calculation of Required Working Days:**  
   - **Remaining Work Time** = `estimated_work_time - time_logged`
   - **Weeks Needed** = `Remaining Work Time / allocated_weekly_hours`
   - **Required Working Days** = `Weeks Needed * working_days_per_week`

4. **Considering Available Working Days Until Deadline:**  
   - **Available Days** = Number of remaining **working days** (accounting for `working_days_per_week`).
   - **Urgency Evaluation:**  
     - If `Required Working Days > Available Days` â†’ **URGENT**  
     - If `Required Working Days <= Available Days` â†’ **On Track**

## Future Features (Planned):

1. **Dynamic Priority Adjustment:**  
   Automatically shifts focus to urgent projects as deadlines approach.

2. **Daily Task List:**  
   Generates a list of the most urgent tasks for each day.

3. **Warning System & Notifications:**  
   Alerts when projects risk missing deadlines.

4. **Planned Days Off (Vacations/Business Trips):**  
   - Ability to define **planned days off** in settings (e.g., vacations, business trips).
   - These are considered in the calculation of available working days.

   **Example in YAML:**  
   ```yaml
   planned_days_off:
     - 2024-02-12  # Vacation
     - 2024-02-14  # Business Trip
   ```

5. **Global `master_log.md`:**  
   Central log file summarizing time entries across all projects for a comprehensive overview.
